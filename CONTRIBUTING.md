Contributing to awesome-pi-agent

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

Guidelines

- Please fork and create a feature branch (do not commit to `main`).
- Keep entries concise: one-line description + link. Tags (hook, tool, skill, theme, example) are encouraged.
- Add resources under the most relevant category. If none apply, propose a new category in a PR.
- Include attribution and a short note if the resource is unofficial or experimental.

Repository rules

- No automated pushes to upstream without explicit approval from the repository owner.
- Open a Pull Request and request a review before merging.

If you want me (the agent) to push or create the GitHub repository and open a PR, please reply and explicitly grant permission.
